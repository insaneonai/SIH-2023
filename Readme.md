# English to Hindi Translator with 8-bit Quantization


This repository contains the backend code for authentication, email verification, and cookie validation in Node.js, along with a Python server script for a Transformer model that translates English to Hindi and performs inference using 8-bit quantization.


# Features


- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication system implemented using Node.js.
- **Email Verification**: Email verification system to ensure the validity of user email addresses.

- **Cookie Validation**: Secure validation of cookies to maintain user sessions.

- **English to Hindi Translation**: Utilizes a Transformer model for translating text from English to Hindi.

- **8-bit Quantization**: Implements 8-bit quantization to reduce the model size and improve inference speed.
